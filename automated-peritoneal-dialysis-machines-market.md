<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automated Peritoneal Dialysis Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Power Type</li><li>Gravity Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD) machines market is divided into two primary types: power type and gravity type. Power type machines utilize electricity to regulate the dialysate flow and pressure, offering precise control and faster treatment cycles. In contrast, gravity type machines rely on the gravitational pull for the dialysate to fill and drain the peritoneal cavity, making them simpler but typically slower in operation. Both types cater to patient preferences and clinical needs within the dialysis landscape.</p></p>
