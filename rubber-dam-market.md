<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rubber Dam Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inflatable Rubber Dam</li><li>Water-filled Rubber Dam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rubber dam market comprises two primary types: inflatable rubber dams and water-filled rubber dams. Inflatable rubber dams utilize air pressure to create a barrier, allowing for quick deployment and flexible control of water flow. They are often used in temporary applications and can be easily deflated when not in use. On the other hand, water-filled rubber dams rely on water for stability and are typically used in more permanent installations, providing robust solutions for flood control and irrigation. Both types offer unique advantages for managing water resources.</p></p>
